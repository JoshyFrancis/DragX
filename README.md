# Drag Auto Scroll
Extended Drag n Drop Library in Javascript.
<br>
I couldn't find a javascript drag and drop library which is capable of auto scrolling. So I made my own. I will update things when I get time. I am bad at explaining things. Please forgive me.
<br>
View a <a href="https://joshyfrancis.github.io/drag_auto_scroll/drag_auto_scroll.htm" target="_blank">Demo</a> and try to drag elements.
See the inner scrolling of elements. Click on the draggable item with handle , press Enter key and use arrow keys to move item.
# Features
  1. Mobile friendly
  2. Nested auto scrolling
  3. No external dependency
  4. Cross browser ( IE9+)
  5. Keyboard interaction
